# FckSignups

> **Open Source Tools. Zero Bullsh*t.**

A curated collection of open-source tools you can use instantly in your browser — no accounts, no emails, no tracking. Just tools that work.

## What is this?

FckSignups is a single-file, dependency-free directory of browser-based tools that respect your time. No signups. No dark patterns. No "create an account to continue." Just open the page, find a tool, and use it.

The entire site is one HTML file. No build step. No npm. No framework. Open it in any browser and it works.

## Philosophy

| We believe | We reject |
|------------|-----------|
| Tools should work immediately | Forced registration walls |
| Your data belongs to you | Data harvesting and tracking |
| Open source is the default | Proprietary black boxes |
